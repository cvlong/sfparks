<h3>About <span style='font-family: Montserrat', sans-serif>SFparks</span></h3>
<br>
SFparks is an interactive web application using Flask MVC framework for easily searching the city for parks and public open spaces based on a user preferences. Whether you only have 5 minutes to stroll somewhere nearby or long break to take a 20 minute bike ride, SFparks has got you covered. This app takes into account how long a user will allot for travel and whether theyâ€™re walking or cycling in order to identify parks and open spaces that match their routing profile. Users can also keep track of their favorite parks and save their search results.
<br><br>
On the server side, park data is stored in a PostgreSQL database. The database is seeded with open source data available on SF OpenData, including <a href="https://data.sfgov.org/Culture-and-Recreation/Park-and-Open-Space-Map/4udc-s3pr">San Francisco Parks and Open Spaces</a> and downtown's <a href="https://data.sfgov.org/Geographic-Locations-and-Boundaries/Privately-Owned-Public-Open-Space-POPOS-and-Public/55um-v9vc">Privately Owned Public Open Spaces</a> data.
